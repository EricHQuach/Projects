This folder contains work I have done as a member of the Texas Spacecraft Laboratory, a research laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin that researches, proposes, and develops nanosatellites as part of the Air Force Research Laboratory's University Nanosatellite Program.

Power_Generated is a MatLab script I helped write as a member of the Electrical Power Systems subteam for our ARMADILLO cubesat (pictured below), which is scheduled to launch in late 2018. The script calculates the approximate power generation of ARMADILLO's solar panels in different orientations to light sources. Its purpose is to help predict the satellite's power generation in orbit and provide estimated values that are used in determining the satellite's power budget.
