This folder contains the schematics for the PCB that I designed as a member of Longhorn Racing Electric. The Rear CPU acts as the "brain" of the vehicle, connecting and controlling various sensors and subsystems across the rear of the car such as the brake light, cooling system, motor inverter, and power distribution module. The board is capable of communicating over CAN bus and IÂ²C, and primary functions are handled by a TM4C123GH6PMI microcontroller.
