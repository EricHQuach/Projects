This folder contains work that I have done as a member of Longhorn Racing Electric, the University of Texas at Austin's competitor in the annual Formula SAE Electric competition hosted in Lincoln, NE. 

The SAE International Formula SAE program is an engineering design competition for undergraduate and graduate students. The concept behind Formula SAE is that a fictional manufacturing company has contracted a design team to develop a small Formula-style racecar. The prototype racecar is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the racecar is the non-professional weekend autocross racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules whose purpose is both to ensure onsite event operations and promote clever problem solving. The vehicle will be inspected in a series of tests to ensure it complies with the competition rules; in addition, the vehicle with driver will be judged in many performance tests on track. The rest of the judging is completed by experts from motorsports, automotive, aerospace and supplier industries on student design, cost and sales presentations.

Within Longhorn Racing Electric, I serve as a member of the Electronics (ELC) subteam. My primary responsibility is to design, assemble, and integrate numerous custom PCBs into the low-voltage controls system of the vehicle. In addition, I am responsible for overseeing integration of the controls system into the vehicle, collaborating with mechanical engineers to design robust electrical enclosures and helping architect the wiring harness and distributed CAN communications system, as well as developing embedded firmware that runs on our boards.
