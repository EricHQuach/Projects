The Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD) is a non-programmable PCB I designed as a member of Longhorn Racing Electric, the University of Texas at Austin's FSAE Electric team. It is located at the front of the race car, and its primary purpose is to act as a failsafe for the vehicle's control system by opening the vehicle's shutdown circuit and immediately stopping the car when it detects both a 'brake' signal from the pedals and positive current from the motor controller together for an extended period of time. It works in conjunction with the vehicle's battery management system (BMS), which possesses the current sensor and transmits a "trip current" digital signal to the BSPD once the current threshold (~18A) has been exceeded.

The board operates by receiving digital signals and power from both the dashboard PCB and potentiometers attached to the pedals. Pedal data is passed through a comparator to verify the brake signal, and both brake signal and trip current signal from the BMS are given as inputs to an AND gate to determine the plausibility of the brake system. The result is fed to a delay block which records the duration of the signal. In the event of implausibility lasting for more than 500ms, a HIGH signal is fed to the reset input of a quad R/S latch, which opens the shutdown circuit, shuts down the vehicle's entire electrical system, and brings the car to a halt.
