LHRe-19, codenamed "The Real Thing", was Longhorn Racing Electric's entry into the 2019 Formula SAE Electric competition, hosted in Lincoln, NE from June 19-22, 2019. The Real Thing was an evolution of the 2018 vehicle "Leap of Faith", which placed 18th overall at the 2018 FSAE Electric competition, and is the first FSAE Electric vehicle from the state of Texas to successfully race at competition. 

I was responsible for designing two of the boards in the vehicle's low-voltage controls system, the Front Control Unit (FCU) and the CAN Bridge. The Front Control Unit (FCU) is the primary board of the front electronics assembly and of the entire controls system, acting as essentially the "brain" of the controls system. The FCU is directly responsible for controlling the motor inverter, generating torque commands based on values from potentiometers mounted to the pedals assembly and delivering them to the motor inverter to propel the vehicle forwards at high speeds. The CAN Bridge PCB is a small board in the front electronics assembly that is designed to help facilitate communications with other boards and electronic components through a variety of communication
protocols such as CAN, USB, and UART. In the vehicle, the purpose of the CAN Bridge PCB is to interface the vehicleâ€™s serial radio, which is used for trackside telemetry.
