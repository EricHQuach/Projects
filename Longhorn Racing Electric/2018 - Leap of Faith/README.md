LHRe-18, affectionately named "Leap of Faith", was Longhorn Racing Electric's entry into the 2018 Formula SAE Electric competition, hosted in Lincoln, NE from June 20-23, 2018. I was responsible for developing two boards in the vehicle's low-voltage controls system, the Rear CPU and the Brake System Plausibility Device (BSPD). The Rear CPU acts as the "brain" of the vehicle, while the BSPD is a failsafe circuit in the event of a control systems failure. In addition, I assisted with the construction of the vehicle's battery, helping spot weld nickle-strip fuses for all 720 battery cells to create the battery pack, assembling and doing bring-up of the vehicle's battery management system (BMS), and constructing the battery control unit, which housed the BMS master board, current sensors, contactors, and high-voltage wiring. 

In addition to my hardware work, I wrote software to help control the vehicle. I wrote driver software for our Tritium WaveSculptor200 motor inverter that allowed for powered control and supported communications over CAN bus. This code was used to successfully drive the car for the first time at the 2018 FSAE Electric competition. I also developed a software state machine that runs in the main code of the Rear CPU. The vehicle's control system is structured so that most decision-making is done by the Rear CPU, with the other boards sending it data and information to make the correct decisions. The state machine traverses states based on this information, and the behavior of the vehicle is determined by which state it is currently in.
